# Welcome into my C++ sandbox :)  
  
You can follow my path around c++ (and maybe later, around some Unreal projects) wich i decided to start since the chinese happy new year (don't try to figure out the link) throw : 
  
**Codecademy**  
**Openclassroom**  
**Sololearn**  
**Udemy**  
And maybe more...  
  
Each folder with those names are supposed to contain the exercices from thoses courses only (I promess i'll do my best to keep them as much tidy than possible), so no need to spent time overthere if you only want to check my personnal projects. On time, there will be a folder for this, I mean, I hope so.  
  
Also, if you came here from a weird sequence of coincidences, and you feel totally lost about who am i, what am i doing here, and you want to learn more about my profil you can check here :
